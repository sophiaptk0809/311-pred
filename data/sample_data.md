# Data Folder Instructions

All data files are stored in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yRkXccV5pG-vJD93VJ6cPRPnHxwE8rjT?usp=sharing).  
To use them in this project, please follow these steps:

1. Download the necessary raw data files from Google Drive and place them in the `raw/` folder.
2. Place any supporting files in the `support/` folder.
3. After running the data cleaning and weather notebooks, the cleaned and processed data will be saved in the `processed/` folder.

**Folder structure:**
- `raw/` — for all original, unprocessed data files
- `support/` — for any supporting or reference files
- `processed/` — for cleaned and processed data outputs

Be sure to run the data cleaning notebook and the weather notebook to process the raw data.
